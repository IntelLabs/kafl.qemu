# kAFL-Qemu

This repository hosts stable and feature branches of [QEMU-Nyx](http://github.com/nyx-fuzz/QEMU-Nyx) that are tested for use with [kAFL](http://github.com/IntelLabs/kAFL).

***Note: All components are provided for research and validation purposes only. Use at your own Risk***

Branches overview:
- `master` - info / attribution (this page)
- `qemu-nyx-<version>` follows upstream [Qemu-Nyx](http://github.com/nyx-fuzz/QEMU-Nyx) version
- `kafl-<version>` - versioned/stable branches used by kAFL (expect to closely follow Qemu-Nyx)
- `<topic>-<version>` - branches and derivates for other / experimental usages

Whenever possible, post patches/issues against the upstream top-level [kAFL](http://github.com/IntelLabs/kAFL/), [Nyx](http://github.com/nyx-fuzz/) or [QEMU-Nyx](http://github.com/nyx-fuzz/QEMU-Nyx) projects.
